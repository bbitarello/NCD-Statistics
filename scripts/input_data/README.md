#These files are too big to be uploaded to github.
#They will be provided by the author upon request in the form of a bgzip file that can be decompressed inside this directory.
#then the following directories will be generated: 
#outgroup_files: FD files between human and chimp for each chromosome
#chr1-chr22: separate directories for each chromosome containing processed VCF filees from 1000G Phase I as described in the Methods section of the paper.
